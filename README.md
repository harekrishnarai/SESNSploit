# Snare

A tool for identifying and exploiting misconfigurations in AWS SNS and SES services.

## Overview

Snare is designed to perform various reconnaissance and exploitation tasks related to AWS Simple Notification Service (SNS) and Simple Email Service (SES). It provides a user-friendly interface to check for active regions, inspect topic attributes, list subscriptions, send messages, and detect misconfigurations.

  ```bash
  python snare.py
  ```

- You will be greeted with a menu offering several options:

  ```
  1. Check Active Regions for SNS
  2. Check Active Regions for SES
  3. Get SNS Topic Attributes
  4. List Subscriptions for an SNS Topic
  5. Send a Message to an SNS Topic
  6. Brute-Force Check Regions for SNS and SES
