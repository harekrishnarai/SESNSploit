# Attack Scenario 1: SNS Topic Hijacking

## Overview
This attack scenario demonstrates how an attacker with basic SNS permissions can hijack existing SNS topics to intercept sensitive notifications or inject malicious messages into legitimate communication channels.

## Attack Vector
- **Target**: Misconfigured SNS topics with overly permissive policies
- **Method**: Subscribe unauthorized endpoints to existing topics
- **Impact**: Information disclosure, message injection, service disruption

## Prerequisites
- AWS credentials with basic SNS permissions
- Ability to create subscriptions or modify topic policies
- Knowledge of existing SNS topic ARNs

## How to Use SESNSploit for This Attack

### Step 1: Reconnaissance
```bash
python3 main.py
# Select option 1: List SNS active regions
# Select option 2: List SNS topics in active regions
# Select option 3: Get SNS topic attributes (to check policies)
```

### Step 2: Identify Vulnerable Topics
Look for topics with policies that allow:
- `sns:Subscribe` from any principal
- Wildcard permissions (`*`)
- Cross-account access without proper conditions

### Step 3: Execute the Attack
```bash
# Use option 4: Subscribe to SNS topic
# Subscribe your controlled endpoint (email, HTTP, SQS, etc.)
```

### Step 4: Exploit
- Monitor intercepted messages
- Inject malicious notifications
- Use gained information for further attacks

## Potential Impact
1. **Data Exfiltration**: Intercept sensitive notifications
2. **Social Engineering**: Send fake alerts to users
3. **Service Disruption**: Overwhelm subscribers with spam
4. **Lateral Movement**: Use topic information to discover other services

## Detection Indicators
- Unexpected subscriptions to SNS topics
- Unusual subscription endpoints
- High volume of messages to unauthorized endpoints
- CloudTrail events: `Subscribe`, `Publish`, `SetTopicAttributes`
